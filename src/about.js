              I am a problem solver. I love breaking down ideas and creating
              elegant, efficient solutions. I get excited about details. I enjoy
              learning new skills and believe Iâ€™ll always be learning and
              growing as an engineer. My objectives are to provide for my
              family, grow as a leader, serve my co-workers well, and to help
              the company that employs me to thrive.

              I am an accomplished senior software engineer with a track record
              of delivering dependable web applications and technology solutions
              to a non-trivial user base. At my current post, I contribute
              significantly to designing and planning product solutions for
              internal stakeholders as well as SaaS customers. I often work
              closely with Product teams to refine ideas and requirements and
              often help bring them to reality by functioning as a team leader.
