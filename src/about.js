              I am a problem solver. I love breaking down ideas and creating
              elegant, efficient solutions. I get excited about details. I enjoy
              learning new tools and languages and want to improve as an
              engineer. My objectives are also to grow as a leader, to serve my
              co-workers well, and to help the company that employs me to
              thrive.

              I am an accomplished software engineer with a track record of
              delivering dependable web applications to a non-trivial user base
              while maintaining the current codebase and server stack and
              providing sales and marketing support to a small-but-growing
              company. At my current post, I've solo managed and expanded all
              aspects of a product platform from AWS provisioning and deployment
              automation to client-side SPA development across the companyâ€™s
              multiple brands.
